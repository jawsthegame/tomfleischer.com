          <h3>My Two Cents</h3>
          <p>
            Engineering is not about doing something fancy.  It is not about showing off.  It is about solving
            problems, and solving problems alone.  That being said, there is a lot of debate over the best way
            to a solution.  I am a strong believer in iterative development.  It provides enumerable benefits
            to both engineers and their product counterparts.  I believe in absolute transparency.  The engineers
            should know the long term direction of the product, and the product managers should know what they
            getting as quickly and as often as possible.
